1. Move to folder **auxiliaryFiles**  
2. Create new txt file and name it **walletsForWork**
3. !WARNIGN | Make sure that the file is read as a Text File and at the same time does not have **.txt** in its name
  
*Great! Now u can push your private keys to that file*  
1 line = 1 private key  
  
After you add private keys, you need to start **start.bat** and code will begin to work!
